    kill command is not a command to shutdown other proccess it is a command that send signal
###################

    In linux signal are things that you send to ps, terminated, stopped, 
    run again, by sending signal like this you can connect ps to ps that
    are running

    The signal that kill send is "kill -<signal name>", if you 省略 the 
    signal name then the default val will be TERM it means that these 2
    have the same meaning:
    
    kill 4695 == kill -TERM 4695 

    Because the number of TERM signal is 15 the next command will also have
    the same meaning:

    kill -15 4695

    The TERM signal we got here mean Terminate that is why if you don't give
    any option (-signal) then the default will be terminate kill the ps.

    The ctrl z, ctrl c are also sending signal to ps as well (ctrl z: TSTP,
    ctrl c: INT) from all of these signal jobs will be stopped or terminated
    there will be SIG before the name of signal's name that is why they will
    be seen as SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGKLL, SIGTSTP

    NOTE: the SIGKILL is an exception which don't send signal to ps but 
    directly excuted by the Linux's kernel, every kill excuted by Linux's 
    kernel will be forced to terminate, only use for the ps that SIGTERM 
    not work on, only use it as the last chance you have.
