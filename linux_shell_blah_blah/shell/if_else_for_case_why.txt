    ##### if 
    
    You can use both space or tab to indent the script
    Like normal programming language the if statement work like others. Read the if_bin.sh file
    
    First you have to put the space between if and [], you must add then after if or elif script
    to make to script work seem like the script itself need something to indent.

    Second if and elif in shell script don't have condition it may seem like they are using it but
    actually in shell script the things come after if is a command
    Ex:
        if <command1>; then
            do something
        elif <command2>; then
            do something
        elif <command3>; then
            do something
        else
            do something
        fi

     Always end the if statement with fi to state that the if end here
     
     Before and after the command we have the [] it is not just a bracket but actually the shell 
     builtin command (try type [ interminal)
     if [ "$1" = "bin" ]; then
     with [     : command
           "$1"  : arg1
           =     : arg2
           "bin" : arg3
           ]     : arg4
    
    ##
    Exit status
    ##

    Every command in shell return an interger value called status exit when it has exited. And the 
    shell's var stand for this is '$?'
    Ex: ls      # execute ls
          echo $? # output the exit
    
    Normally the exit status of a command is 0, when there is error will be a number not 0. Try the
    s_status.sh file when the error happened the exit status is 2

    ########
    NOTE: all of the exit status's interger of each command have a meaning for it read the man of 
    each command to know what it is 
    Ex: the exit status of ls above is 2 and based on the ls's man page 2 mean that error: can't 
    access something
    ########

    And after the if statement will judge the condition(command) right or wrong, it will return an
    exit status: 
        0 : mean True
        1 : mean False
        
        Kind of reverse what we learned in other programming language

     Like I said before the condition for if statement in shell is a command that is why we can use 
    a command for the if statement like this:
        #!/bin/bash

        if grep -q 'bash' /etc/passwd; then   #In here if the grep found bash in /etc/passwd then -q option will exit with 0 status, else with error(Not sure about the else)
            echo 'bash found'                  # echo bash
         fi

    And so you can use some command's option that return the exit status with if as well
    

    ##### Test command
    Like the [ command this command have the same function as the [ only different that it doesn't
    need the ] at last.
    Ex: 
        if [ "$1" = "bin"]; then
         if test "$1" = "bin"; then

    [ doens't have a sound that why both [ and test are called the test command

    ## Comparison
    1. String:
        str1 = str2  : str1 equal to str2
        str1 != str2 : str1 isn't equal to str2
        -n str1      : str1 isn't empty string
        -z str1      : str1 is empty string

     Try default.sh file

     2. Integer
        int1 -eq int2 : int1 == int2
        int1 -ne int2 : int1 != int2
        int1 -lt int2 : int1 < int2
        int1 -le int2 : int1 <= int2
        int1 -gt int2 : int1 > int2 
        int1 -ge int2 : int1 >= int2
        

    3. File_type
    These are various type of operators to evaluate type of file( find more detail in bash manual - conditional expressions)

    -e file         : file exist
    -d file         : file exist and is dir
    -h file         : file exist and is symbolic 
    -L file         : file exist and is symbolic (like -h)
    -f file         : file exist and is normal file
    -r file         : file exist and is readable file
    -w file         : file exist and is writable file 
    -x file         : file exist and is executable file
    -n str           : string is not null
    -z str           : string length is null
    file1 -nt file2 : file 1 updated time is newer than file 2 
    file1 -ot file2 : file 1 upadted time is older than file 2

    When you want to use many condition at the same time 
    condition1 -a condition2: cond1 AND cond2
    condition2 -o condition2: cond1 OR cond2
    ! cond                  : cond fault
    ()                      : group cond (you need to add \ to ( because ( is a bash's meta 
                                       character 
        Ex: if [ -d "$watever" -a \( "$watever" = '/bin' -o "$watever" =  "/etc") ]; then
                  echo something

    ### && and ||
    This two help you run multiple command at the same time:
     cmd1 && cmd2  : when cmd1 finished and the exit status is 0 the use cmd2 which mean that if 
                          command 1 finished normally then the command 2 will be executed
        Ex:  [ -f file.txt ] && cat file.txt

    cmd1 || cmd2  :
